# SPA Routing Fix Deployment Guide

## Problem Fixed
- **Issue**: Direct URL access to pages (like `/privacy`, `/terms`, `/support`) resulted in 404 errors
- **Impact**: Google Play Console couldn't access legal pages directly
- **Solution**: Added Vercel SPA routing configuration

## Files Created/Modified

### 1. `vercel.json` (NEW)
```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "destination": "/index.html"
    }
  ],
  "headers": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "headers": [
        {
          "key": "X-Frame-Options",
          "value": "DENY"
        },
        {
          "key": "X-Content-Type-Options",
          "value": "nosniff"
        },
        {
          "key": "Referrer-Policy",
          "value": "strict-origin-when-cross-origin"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### 2. `public/404.html` (NEW)
- Static fallback 404 page for edge cases
- Matches Studio 402 branding
- Provides navigation back to home

### 3. `src/views/NotFoundView.vue` (NEW)  
- Vue component for 404 handling
- Integrated with animation system
- Theme-aware styling

### 4. `src/router/index.js` (MODIFIED)
- Added catch-all route: `/:pathMatch(.*)*`
- Routes to NotFoundView component

## Testing URLs (After Deployment)

All these URLs should now work directly:
- https://studio-402-website.vercel.app/
- https://studio-402-website.vercel.app/privacy
- https://studio-402-website.vercel.app/terms  
- https://studio-402-website.vercel.app/support
- https://studio-402-website.vercel.app/contact
- https://studio-402-website.vercel.app/about
- https://studio-402-website.vercel.app/projects

## Google Play Console Compliance

✅ **Privacy Policy**: https://studio-402-website.vercel.app/privacy
✅ **Terms & Conditions**: https://studio-402-website.vercel.app/terms  
✅ **Support Page**: https://studio-402-website.vercel.app/support

## How It Works

1. **Vercel Rewrites**: All routes are rewritten to serve `index.html`
2. **Vue Router**: Client-side routing takes over and displays the correct component
3. **Fallback**: If JavaScript fails, static 404.html is served
4. **Security**: Headers protect against common web vulnerabilities

## Deployment Steps

1. Commit all changes to git
2. Push to GitHub repository  
3. Vercel will automatically deploy with new configuration
4. Test all direct URLs to ensure they work

## Verification

After deployment, test by:
1. Opening privacy page directly in browser
2. Sharing direct links to legal pages
3. Confirming Google Play Console can access required pages
